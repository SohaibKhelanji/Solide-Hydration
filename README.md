## Overview

Many people struggle to meet their daily water intake goals, and our project aims to address this issue in an innovative and eco-friendly way. Rather than promoting the purchase of expensive smart water bottles, i've developed a sensor that can be easily attached to existing water bottles, transforming them into smart hydration trackers.

## Key Features

- **Universal Compatibility:** Our sensor can be attached to almost any small to medium-sized water bottle, making it a versatile solution for users with their favorite reusable bottles.
  
- **Cost-Effective:** Instead of investing in a complete smart water bottle, users can enhance their existing bottles by adding our sensor. This not only saves money but also encourages the continued use of their preferred bottles.

- **Environmental Impact:** By promoting the use of reusable bottles and discouraging the purchase of single-use plastic bottles, our project contributes to a more sustainable and eco-friendly approach to hydration tracking.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Smart Hydration Sensor, follow the setup instructions in the project documentation. Connect the sensor to your Micro:bit v2 and start tracking your hydration.

## Usage
